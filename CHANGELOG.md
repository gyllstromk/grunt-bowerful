## Bug fixes

* Fixed bug in which `package.json` was assumed to exist if `component.json` and `bower.json` did not
* Fixed bug in which `base` was prepended to the guessed file's path which caused later reads to fail

# 0.3.0

## Enhancements

Copy files recursively if `customtarget` is a directory (@johannestroeger)
